Student Marks Predictor

Education is very important issue regarding development of a country. The main objective of educational institutions is to provide high quality education to its students. One way to accomplish this is by predicting student's academic performance and thereby taking early steps to improve student's performance and teaching quality.

This system aims to predict student's marks using linear regression. The idea behind this analysis is to predict the marks of students by their studying hours.Through this project we can determine:
1. How many hours is required to study to get 99% marks?
2. If we will do study x() hours per day so how much marks we will get?
Through these points the school can determine the performance of the student.

To implement this model I am using Google Collab. The libraries used are Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib. There is a scatter plot at the end to show the graphical form to data analysed and relation between variables.
